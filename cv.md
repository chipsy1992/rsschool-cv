### Summary

I work as a personal and condicional trainer, but that is not the job I want to do. So I finished IT Academy in Belgrade, and I realized that programming is something where I can find myself.
I have already learned some of **HTML** and **CSS** and **JavaScript** on my own, but I am hoping I can go into more depth within this course.

### Skills

As I already mentioned I do not have much experience in programing however, I know basics of:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- PHP;
- MySql;
- VScode;
- GitHub.
